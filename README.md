# ExcelJS Practice Repository

Welcome to my **ExcelJS Practice** repository! ðŸŽ‰

## About

This repository is dedicated to exploring and learning the [ExcelJS](https://github.com/exceljs/exceljs) library. ExcelJS is a powerful Node.js library used for reading, creating, and modifying Excel files (`.xlsx`).

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of ExcelJS and how it can integrate with automation workflows, complementing my previous work from the [playwright-practice](https://github.com/ryandocherty/playwright-practice) repository. Specifically, I aim to:

- Practice manipulating Excel files programmatically.
- Use ExcelJS in conjunction with Playwright for test data management and reporting.
- Build reusable scripts to read from and write to Excel workbooks.
